about game 

The Cricket Tournament Game is a simple CLI-based simulation of a cricket match between a player and the computer. It captures the
essence of cricket's batting and bowling mechanics through a number-matching system. The game is designed to be easy to understand
while providing an engaging experience.
The game uses random number generation to simulate the unpredictability of cricket matches. Each batting innings continues until a
wicket falls (when the batting and bowling numbers match), creating tension as players try to maximize their score before getting
out.
